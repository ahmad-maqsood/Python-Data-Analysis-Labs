# 🧠 Tasks (No Solutions. You suffer productively.)

## 1️⃣ Basic Exploration

* Show first 5 rows
* Check data types
* Check missing values
* Get statistical summary

---

## 2️⃣ Feature Engineering

* Create `Total_Spent` if not given
* Extract month from `Purchase_Date`
* Create age groups (18–25, 26–35, etc.)

---

## 3️⃣ Analysis Questions

### A. Spending Behavior

* What is the average spending per customer?
* Which age group spends the most?
* Does gender impact average purchase amount?

### B. Product Insights

* Which product category generates the highest revenue?
* Which category sells the most quantity?
* Revenue per category bar chart

### C. Time Trends

* Monthly revenue trend
* Identify highest revenue month

### D. Correlation

* Correlation between Age and Total_Spent
* Correlation between Quantity and Purchase_Amount
* Interpret properly (no “correlation = causation” nonsense)

## 4️⃣ Visualization Requirements (Matplotlib Only)

You must create:

* Histogram of Age
* Boxplot of Purchase_Amount by Gender
* Bar chart of Revenue by Category
* Line plot of Monthly Revenue
* Scatter plot of Age vs Total_Spent

Label everything properly. Titles. Axis labels. Clean layout.

If your plot looks like default chaos, fix it.
