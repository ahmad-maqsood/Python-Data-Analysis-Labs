## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains small-to-medium data analysis projects created as part of my practice and learning process.

The goal is to strengthen my understanding of:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summaries
- Data visualization
- Writing clean, structured analysis code

All projects are implemented using:

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

Each project typically includes:

- A defined problem statement or task
- Dataset exploration
- Data cleaning (if required)
- Analysis and insights
- Visualizations

The questions or problem statements included in the notebooks are generated with the help of ChatGPT.

All solutions, code implementations, analysis logic, and interpretations are written and implemented by me.

Datasets used in this repository are either:
- Collected from publicly available sources on the internet, or
- Generated with the assistance of ChatGPT for practice purposes.

## 📂 Project Structure

Each project folder may contain:

- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file
- Dataset file (if applicable)
- Visual outputs (if saved separately)

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- A structured record of my learning journey
- A practical portfolio of data analysis work
- A foundation before moving into more advanced topics like machine learning

---

## 📈 Future Plans

- Add more structured EDA projects
- Improve visualization quality
- Incorporate statistical analysis
- Build mini dashboards
- Transition into machine learning-based projects
